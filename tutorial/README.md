# SNAKE GAME

We're going for a **snake game**, a bit like slither.io, but then without the adds.

So the game concept is that you get to see _a snake_ and it's _food_.
With your arrow keys you are to guide the snake to the food.
**The more you eat, the more you grow**
**! BEWARE !** you are not to hit your own body or the canvas borders head-on or the game is over
