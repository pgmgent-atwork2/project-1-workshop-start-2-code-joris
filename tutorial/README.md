# SNAKE GAME TUTORIAL

We made a **snake game**, a bit like slither.io, but then without the adds.

In this tutorial you'll learn how to make a simplified version of it. We also have a more elaborate variant, which you can find in my Github repo. This version is fully functional though!

In case you don't know the game: you get to see _a snake_ and its _food_.<br>
With the arrow keys of your keyboard you guide the snake to the food.

**The more you eat, the more you grow**<br>
As you progress in the game, you'll also see random lines of coding wisdom, so you get the feeling you are doing something useful afterall :)

**! BEWARE !** you are not to hit your own body or the canvas borders head-on or the game is over<br>
